            is posted, whether on our digital properties or on applications we

            us offline in our physical properties, such as in our stores, theme

            We follow this privacy policy in accordance with applicable law in
            the places where we operate. In some cases, we may provide
            additional data privacy notices specific to certain products,
            practices, or regions. Those terms are to be read in conjunction
